# Tipping Neural Network Simulation Project

This is a research project into the possibility of producing a mathematical model of epileptic seizure activity in the brain.
It differs from many others in that, instead of taking a top-down empirical approach based on EEG data, it takes a bottom-up, generative approach.
The project uses data and resources from the PyOpenWorm library.
